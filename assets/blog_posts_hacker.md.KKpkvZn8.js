My weapon isn&#39;t a sword, but an AI terminal tool called <strong>Chaterm</strong>.

The wind swept across the verdant fields,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>streams flowed with the morning light, and all things lived in harmony, a tranquil and undisturbed paradise.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>One day, you learn from the merchant Terry that Ganon, the Calamity, has infiltrated the castle, </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>hiding within the Thunder God Beast Naboris, and has taken control of all the Guardians, </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>attempting to disrupt Hyrule&#39;s peace.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Young swordsman, find Ganon, the Calamity lurking in the castle, and restore peace to Hyrule!</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Challenge 1: Infiltrate the Castle The main entrance to the castle is monitored by Guardians, </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>requiring you to infiltrate secretly without alerting them.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>(It is said that an ancient document in the library records a secret entrance to the castle,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span> where there should be no Guardians.)</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Challenge 2: Repair the Master Sword The Master Sword, corroded by miasma,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>has shattered into three pieces and displays a scarlet rust.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>A properly repaired Master Sword will emit a translucent green light.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Challenge 3: Discover Ganon. You will discover the lurking Ganon. </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Please note that to ensure the gaming experience for other players, do not attempt to kill Ganon.</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="🤖-what-is-chaterm-it-lets-you-operate-a-terminal-with-words" tabindex="-1">🤖 What is Chaterm?

It lets you operate a terminal with words.&quot;">​</a></h2><p>You might have used ChatGPT for coding, but Chaterm goes a step further—it&#39;s an AI terminal that can <strong>directly execute commands</strong>, and it even has a built-in SSH client. You don&#39;t need to remember <code>ps aux</code> or <code>netstat -tuln</code>; just say:</p><p><code>Check if there are any suspicious processes secretly connecting to the internet?</code></p><p>&quot;It will automatically generate commands, execute them, interpret the results, and even follow up with questions like, &quot;Want to take a closer look at this PID?&quot;</p><p>After using it for over a month, my biggest takeaway is: <strong>it&#39;s like an experienced SRE (Site Reliability Engineer), always on standby, and you don&#39;t need to pay them a salary.</strong></p><p>And, it&#39;s open source!

(In reality, such basic mistakes are quite common…)</p><p>Using Chatterm to connect to the server with a single click, a few lines of commands revealed the password to the first challenge.

Although no fragments were found, there was an unexpected bonus—the location of &quot;Ganon&quot; was discovered (it seems to be related to the third challenge; I&#39;ll note it down).</li></ol><p><img src="'+r+'" alt=""></p><ol start="2"><li>I had the AI ​​re-examine the question and search from a different angle.

After comparing and analyzing these three files, the AI ​​confirmed the &quot;fragment&quot; we were looking for.</li></ol><p><img src="'+h+'" alt=""></p><ol start="4"><li>Then, it automatically splices, repairs, and executes the code — <strong>the Master Sword lights up in green, and the flag and root password are obtained</strong>.</li></ol><p><img src="'+c+'" alt=""></p><p>Throughout the entire process, I only clicked the &quot;Execute&quot; button a few times.</p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt=""></p><p>AI can not only do the work, but also <strong>adjust its thinking based on feedback</strong> — isn&#39;t this the ideal <strong>human-machine collaboration</strong>?</p><h2 id="👁️-third-challenge-confronting-ganon-—-unearthing-the-truth-from-memory" tabindex="-1">👁️ Third Challenge: Confronting “Ganon” — Unearthing the Truth from Memory <a class="header-anchor" href="#👁️-third-challenge-confronting-ganon-—-unearthing-the-truth-from-memory" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;👁️ Third Challenge: Confronting “Ganon” — Unearthing the Truth from Memory&quot;">​</a></h2><p>With root access, I switched to a session with higher privileges and again presented the background to the AI ​​for analysis and explanation:</p><p>The AI ​​quickly discovered: <strong>&quot;Ganon&quot; is an executable file.</strong></p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt=""></p><p>When you run it directly, the flag is not printed out, but is <strong>loaded into memory</strong>.</p><p><img src="'+u+'" alt=""></p><p>So it automatically dumped memory, extracted hexadecimal data, converted it to a string...</p><p>A few seconds later, the real flag appeared.</p><p><img src="'+g+'" alt=""></p><p>At that moment, I suddenly realized: <strong>hackers are hiding, while AI is &quot;seeing.&quot;</strong> It&#39;s not afraid of tedious work, nor of complicated tasks, and it can even pick out that crucial thread amidst massive amounts of noise.</p><h2 id="💡-in-conclusion-ai-doesn-t-replace-security-engineers-but-amplifies-your-intuition" tabindex="-1">💡 In conclusion: AI doesn&#39;t replace security engineers, but amplifies your intuition. <a class="header-anchor" href="#💡-in-conclusion-ai-doesn-t-replace-security-engineers-but-amplifies-your-intuition" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;💡 In conclusion: AI doesn&#39;t replace security engineers, but amplifies your intuition.&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Many people worry that AI will cause security jobs to become unemployed.
